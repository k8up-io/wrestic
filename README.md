* `KEEP_TAG` what tags should be kept **Not yet implemented**
* `PROM_URL` Prometheus push gateway url
* `BACKUP_DIR` directory that should get backed up, default: `/data`
* `STATS_URL` url where additional after backup stats get pushed to
* `BACKUP_LIST_TIMEOUT` set the timeout for listing snapshots, default 30 secs
* `RESTORE_S3ENDPOINT` s3 endpoint where the tar.gz with all files should be uploaded, example `http://localhost:9000/bucketName`
* `RESTORE_ACCESSKEYID` s3 accesKeyID for the restore s3 endpoint
* `RESTORE_SECRETACCESSKEY` s3 secretAccessKey for the restore s3 endpoint

* `FILEEXTENSION_ANNOTATION` name of the file extension annotation, default: `k8up.syn.tools/file-extension`

Configuration for the Restic repository also has to be provided via env variables. See the official [docs](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Execution
First build the container:

```
cd cmd/wrestic
docker build -t wrestic/wrestic .
```

Then run the container and mount the folders you'd like to be backed up to `/data`:
```
docker run -e "HOSTNAME=test" -e "PROM_URL=http://192.168.1.43:9091" -v /path/to/back:/data/ wrestic/wrestic
```

Run a check of the repository:
```
docker run -e "HOSTNAME=test" -e "PROM_URL=http://192.168.1.43:9091" -v /path/to/back:/data/ wrestic/wrestic -check
```

Run a restore to disk:
```
docker run -e "HOSTNAME=test" -v /path/for/restore:/restore wrestic -restore -restoreType folder
```

Run a restore to disk with a filter:
```
docker run -e "HOSTNAME=test" -v /patch/for/restore:/restore wrestic -restore -restoreType folder -restoreFilter /var/mysql
```

Run a restore to S3:
```
docker run -e "HOSTNAME=test" -e "RESTORE_S3ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000/bucketName" -e "RESTORE_ACCESSKEYID=1324" -e "RESTORE_SECRETACCESSKEY=secret" wrestic -restore -restoreType s3
```

The container will exit after the job is done. If a valid `PROM_URL` is provided it will push metrics there.
